\section{Ensemble: Adaboost}

Adaboost has following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It minimizes exponential loss forwardly.
    \item It trains max-margin classifiers.
    \item It, as well as Random Forest, is spiky self-averaging interpolators, which localize the effect of noise.
    \item It falls into the double descent regime: over-parameterized models can have better generalization.
\end{enumerate}
