\section{Generative Models}

Variational Autoencoder: use approximated probability to model $p(z \mid x)$ and the $p(x\mid z)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: can be used as feature representation.
    \item Con: generated images are blurrier and relatively low compared to GAN.
\end{itemize}

Generative Adversarial Network: use 2-player game to sample from $p(x)$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: SOTA.
    \item Con: (1) unstable, (2) potential mode collapse and (3) cannot solve $p(x)$.
\end{itemize}
